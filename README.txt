#Make your linux launchers
* sometimes we are downloading some applications from websites.
* when we want to launch them we can't find them into the launcher menu in linux
* (it is not true about .dpkg and .rpm just for .tar.gz files that can't make launcher)
* you can make a launcher in launcher menu via this appilcatin

Todo:
	1.install the jre (at least jre 8)
	2.run the launcher-maker.jar by "java -jar launcher-maker.jar"
		(you don't need to linux-launcher-maker folder)(run it by root (sudo) recomended)
	3.write at least the essential parts that highlighted by pink color
	
Thank you for donwloading :)
